The Unix Philosophy
From The UNIX Programming Environment (1984) by Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike

Even though the UNIX system introduces a number o finnovativ eprorams and techniques, no single program or idea makes it work well.  Instead, what makes it effective is the approach to programming, a philosophy of using the ocmputer. Although that philosophy can't be written down in a single sentence, at its hears is the idea that the power of a system comes more from the relationships among programs than from the programs themselves. Many UNIX programs do quite trivial thinkgs in isolation, but, combined with other programs, become general and useful tools.
